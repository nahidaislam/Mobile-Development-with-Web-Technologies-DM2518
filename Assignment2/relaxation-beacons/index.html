			<h1> Gamla Stan (Old Town)</h1>
			<p>
				Dating from the 1200s and crammed with must-see sights, attractions, cafés, authentic restaurants,
				and boutique shops, the area of Gamla Stan (Old Town) is a living-breathing museum in its own right.
				For many, this is the first stop on their journey of exploration. Certainly there's no better way to
				instantly absorb the feel of Stockholm and get to grips with the city's culture. Plenty of souvenirs and gifts
				are available in the Old Town, and you will find yourself transported back to medieval times as you meander
				through a bewildering labyrinth of tiny, winding streets. Mysterious vaults and ancient frescoes lurk behind
				picturesque facades. If visiting in winter, be sure to take in the marvellous Julmarknad (Christmas Market),
				an experience akin to being in a fairy tale. Stockholm Cathedral, the Nobel Museum, and the Royal Palace are all
				located here and should be high up on any sightseeing itinerary. If visiting the Royal Palace be sure to catch the changing of the guard.

			<h1>Djurgården</h1>
				<p>
					A tranquil oasis in the heart of the city, the island of Djurgården draws tourists and locals alike,
					particularly during the summer months of long lazy days and short nights. The park forms part of the Royal National City Park,
					and it's a perfect place for a stroll and picnic as well as being home to several of Stockholm's top museums and other attractions.
					Scattered about are pleasant cafés, restaurants, snack-bars, and hotels. You can hire bicycles to explore the forest trails or,
					if you're feeling adventurous, take to the waterways in a canoe. The popular Vasa Museum and Abba the Museum are located here,
					as is the open-air museum Skansen and Gröna Lund amusement park. A fun way to arrive is by ferry from Gamla Stan or Slussen (both on the T-Bana).
					Alternatively, jump on a tram from Norrmalmstorg, take the bus, or stroll from the city center (15 minutes).
					Drop by the Djurgården visitor center for more information.

			<h1>Vasa Museum</h1>
				<p>
					The incredible Vasa battleship was intended to be the pride of the Swedish Imperial fleet,
					yet in a forerunner of the Titanic disaster centuries later, sank on its maiden voyage in 1628.
					An amazing salvage operation took place in 1961, and now you can marvel at this glorious time capsule,
					95 percent of which is entirely original. The three masts on the roof of the museum are not just a tourist draw;
					they were reconstructed to the exact height and specifications of the original masts.
					This is the most visited museum in Sweden, and rightfully so. More than one million people a year come here to
					enjoy the different exhibitions and watch the movie on the ship's history. Entry is free if you are under 18 years of age.
